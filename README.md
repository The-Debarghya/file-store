# file-store
- Just another file upload/download app with proper authentication and vulnerability mitigation.
- Key features: File upload vulnerability mitigated by all means, used safe auth mechanism using passport and prevented strange file uploads by restricting only to text,pdf and images.
- Though docker-compose is present it couldn't be used inside railway, so...apologies!
- **P.S- Since our University is very nice and doesn't give us an edu email, I have deployed it to Railway free plan. So please refrain from spamming the repository, cause it can't handle too much uploads. Enough if you try once.**
